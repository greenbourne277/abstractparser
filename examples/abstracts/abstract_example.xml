We find that the answer to the question depends critically on the cost of early redemption. If this cost is small, banknotes will not circulate, so the question is moot. If this cost is large, incentive problems will prevent the issue of banknotes. For intermediate values of the early redemption cost, the option of early redemption limits the bank's risk-taking behavior, so that banknotes will be preferred over checks.</ABSTRACT_BODY><PDF_URL>asd99928</PDF_URL><PAPER_JOURNALS>Banking &amp; Financial Institutions, Monetary Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Research Paper Series, Banking &amp; Financial Institutions eJournal, Archives of Vols. 1-4, 2009-12, Monetary Economics eJournal, Archives of Vols. 1-8, 2009-16</PAPER_JOURNALS><ABSTRACT_VIEWS>805</ABSTRACT_VIEWS><DOWNLOADS/><DOWNLOADS_LAST_PERIOD>0</DOWNLOADS_LAST_PERIOD><CITATIONS_IN>0</CITATIONS_IN><ADDED_TO_LIBRARY>0</ADDED_TO_LIBRARY><ADDED_TO_LIBRARY_LAST_PERIOD>0</ADDED_TO_LIBRARY_LAST_PERIOD><SHARED_BY_EMAIL>1</SHARED_BY_EMAIL><N_PAGES/><DOI>FOO</DOI><JELS>E42, G21, N11</JELS><KEYWORDS/><DATE_SUBMITTED></DATE_SUBMITTED><DATE_POSTED>1998-09-22</DATE_POSTED><DATE_REVISED>2014-08-05</DATE_REVISED><SOURCE_INFO/><PAPER_DATE>April 1998</PAPER_DATE><PAPER_TYPE>WPS</PAPER_TYPE><PDF_NAME/></ARTICLE></DATAROOT>
