For a sample of London Stock Exchange stocks, we find that preferenced trades pay higher spreads, however, they do not generate higher dealer profits. Internalized trades pay lower, not higher, spreads. We do not find a relation between the extent of preferencing or internalization, and spreads across stocks. These results do not lend support to the &amp;quot;collusion&amp;quot; hypothesis but are consistent with a &amp;quot;costly search and trading relationships&amp;quot; hypothesis.</ABSTRACT_BODY><PDF_URL>asd100309</PDF_URL><PAPER_JOURNALS>Capital Markets: Market Microstructure eJournal, Capital Markets eJournal, Archives of Vols. 1-5, 1994-98, Corporate Law: Law &amp; Finance eJournal, Capital Markets: Market Microstructure, LSN: Law &amp; Finance: Empirical (Topic), Corporate, Securities &amp; Finance Law eJournal, Archives of Vols. 1-4, 1996-99</PAPER_JOURNALS><ABSTRACT_VIEWS>1122</ABSTRACT_VIEWS><DOWNLOADS/><DOWNLOADS_LAST_PERIOD>0</DOWNLOADS_LAST_PERIOD><CITATIONS_IN>0</CITATIONS_IN><ADDED_TO_LIBRARY>0</ADDED_TO_LIBRARY><ADDED_TO_LIBRARY_LAST_PERIOD>0</ADDED_TO_LIBRARY_LAST_PERIOD><SHARED_BY_EMAIL>2</SHARED_BY_EMAIL><N_PAGES/><DOI/><JELS>G10, D4</JELS><KEYWORDS/><DATE_SUBMITTED></DATE_SUBMITTED><DATE_POSTED>1998-08-08</DATE_POSTED><DATE_REVISED>2001-03-07</DATE_REVISED><SOURCE_INFO>Journal of Finance</SOURCE_INFO><PAPER_DATE/><PAPER_TYPE>APS</PAPER_TYPE><PDF_NAME/></ARTICLE></DATAROOT>
